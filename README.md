### Running the demonstration

In order to run the demo you will need the appropriate libraries. In order to install these modules, please refer to the [MNE-Python](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/install_mne_python.html) website and follow the instructions. In addition you will need a module that will allow to import our custom function to load the BIDS data. Please run _pip install ipynb_ on your terminal or command prompt once you have activated the environment. Once the environment is ready, open the file [_00_getting_started.ipynb](https://github.com/iTCf/mikulan_et_al_2020/blob/master/_00_getting_started.ipynb) (you could use [_jupyter lab_](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to do so), update it with the path of the folder where you downloaded the data and run the cells in order.



If you have any questions please open an issue.
